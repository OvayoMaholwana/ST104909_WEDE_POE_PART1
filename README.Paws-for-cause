PAWS FOR CAUSE. 
 my overview for this project is that i think i outdid myself from the proposal to the coding. The ideas were smart and the cause was good. The website i create looks profesional and will create a lot of traffic.
The "Paws for a Cause" website will feature a homepage with an organizational overview and call-to-action buttons for donations and adoptions, an About Us page with mission, vision, and team information, an Adopt a Pet page with a filterable gallery of adoptable animals and descriptions, a Donate page with a secure donation form, and a Contact page with a contact form and shelter location details, incorporating interactive functionality for the donation form, adoption application form, and pet gallery filters.

 The website aims to raise awareness about animal welfare, encourage donations, and promote pet adoptions. Specific goals include increasing online visibility, collecting donations to fund shelter operations, and facilitating at least five adoptions per month. 

 The project timeline includes finalizing research and submitting proposals in Week 1, developing the HTML structure for all pages in Weeks 2 and 3, testing navigation and gathering feedback in Week 4, and finalizing the Part 1 submission in Week 5.
